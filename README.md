## Motivation

I created this project to further reinforce concepts learned about Reactjs while also developing a familiarity with React Context API and React-Query to develop an app that performs well in caching data for faster fetching as well provide a good user experience in using the app. I did not take part in the creation of the CSS file on this project and was exclusively focused on the React.js fundamentals along with other new technologies mentioned above.

## Description

- allow users to browse remote job postings
- allow users to page forward and backwards for more job postings
- fetch from an API for job posting information
- use the search bar to look for certain keywords in postings
- sort the postings according to date or relevancy.
- bookmark listings that they find enticing
- bookmarks will persist in between listings by using local storage
- can fetch bookmarked listings instantly with React-Query in initial startup of the webapp
- users can share postings by copying the link above and pasting it in the browser
- users can automatically fetch previously seen listings that they have clicked on before with React-Query
- users can bring up previous searches that also utilize React-Query for caching
